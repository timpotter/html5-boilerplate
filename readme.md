#HTML5 & SASS Boilerplate
###Created by [Little Thunder Co.](http://littlethunder.co)

A simple boilerplate we created for starting web projects. Style is controlled by SASS. A Preprocessor like [Codekit](https://incident57.com/codekit/) is required to compile the CSS to `css/style.css`. 

Check out [SASS](http://sass-lang.com/install) for more information.
